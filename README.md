## Project Description

The project aims to scrape election results data from the Election Commission of India's website, perform data analysis to extract key insights, and visualize the results. The insights and visualizations will be saved as a report.

## Data Scraping

The data scraping process involves the following steps:
1. Request the main page of the Election Commission's website.
2. Extract links to results pages for Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies.
3. Scrape each results page for relevant data.
4. Store the scraped data in a pandas DataFrame.

## Data Analysis

The data analysis process includes:
1. Grouping the data by party.
2. Calculating the total number of votes received by each party.
3. Extracting key insights from the data, such as the total number of votes cast.

## Visualization

The project includes a bar chart visualization of the vote distribution by party. The chart is saved as `vote_distribution.png`.

## Results

The results of the analysis, including the key insights, are saved in `report.md`. The total number of votes cast is one of the key insights included in the report.
